# Performance Testing

## Moto G6
With the 4 trees, std material,
facing away from gallery, 2 trees in view, no monkey: 23 fps\
With monkey (with outline) was 8 fps. It's the outline I think.\
Facing gallery with all trees in view: 23 fps\
Removing trees and beds (just the gallery), looking at gallery: 38fps
- Suggests a reasonable cost to the trees\

Just trees and beds: 42fps\
